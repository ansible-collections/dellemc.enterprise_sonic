bugfixes:
  - system - delete an initial test case requiring 'changed' state for deletion
    of final configuration attributes assuming 'leftover' configuration from
    previous execution. Replace this initial test case with cleanup of any
    residual state with no assumption of leftover residual state. Do the final
    deletion of configuration at the end of the test instead of at the beginning
    to retain verification that the deletion works correctly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/87).
