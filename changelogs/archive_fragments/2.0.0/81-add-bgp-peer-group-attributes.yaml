minor_changes:
  - bgp_neighbors - Add BGP peer group support for multiple attributes. The added attributes correspond to the same set of attributes added for BGP neighbors with PR 72 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/81).

breaking_changes:
  - bgp_neighbors - Replace, for BGP peer groups, the previously defined standalone "bfd" attribute with a bfd dictionary containing multiple attributes. This change corresponds to the revised SONiC 4.x implementation of OC YANG compatible REST APIs. Playbooks previously using the bfd attributes for SONiC 3.x images must be modified for useon SONiC 4.0 images to use the new definition for the bfd attribute argspec structure (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/81).
