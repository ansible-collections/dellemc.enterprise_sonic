  - sonic_vlan_mapping - New vlan_mapping resource module. The users of the vlan_mapping resource module with playbooks written for the SONiC 4.1 will need to revise their playbooks based on the new argspec to use those playbooks for SONiC 4.2 and later versions. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/296).
