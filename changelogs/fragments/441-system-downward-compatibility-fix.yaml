bugfixes:
  - sonic_system - Catch the ConnectionError exception caused by unconditional fetching of auditd and ip loadshare hash algorithm configuration, and return empty configuration instead of allowing the uncaught exception to abort all "system" operations on SONiC images older than version 4.4.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/441).
